            <h3>Diesel Generators for Sale in Kenya</h3>
            <p>A diesel generator uses a combination of a diesel generator with an electric motor to produce electricity. Generators can be fueled using natural gas, biofuel, gasoline, or diesel. Of all these types, diesel generators are the most common in Kenya and beyond. If you are searching for a generator for sale in Kenya, you might have found out that most are diesel generators.</p>
            <p>There are many reasons why diesel generators are the most preferred. First is that they are able to run continuously for days on end without any problems. You only need to ensure that there is enough fuel to keep the generator running for the required duration. Diesel generators can stay on for hours, a day to even over a week without any problems. As such they are more versatile and can be used as backups and also as primary sources of electricity.</p>
            <p>Another reason you will find many diesel generators for sale in Kenya is because of their power. Diesel generators are the most powerful and are made for use in instances where a lot of power is required. For this reason, the big industrial generators are diesel fueled.</p>
            <p>Because of their widespread use, there are many technicians with the required expertise to install, service, and maintain diesel generators in Kenya. Further, diesel generators are more fuel efficient than other types of generators. For combustion, air has to mix with fuel in the engine cylinders.
